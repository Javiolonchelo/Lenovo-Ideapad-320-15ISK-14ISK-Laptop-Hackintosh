# Supproted cards

1. Intel® Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165 -  Now supported by OpenIntelWireless thanks to OpenIntelWireless team. For more info please visit https://openintelwireless.github.io/itlwm/ 

2. DW1560 - M.2 (A/E) (BCM94352Z- 867Mbps - BT4.0, pricier, I don't see why would you go with this card if the above is cheaper)

3. DW1830 - M.2 (A/E) (BCM94360 - 1300Mbps - BT4.0, priciest, needs 3 antennas to work to its full potential, works with just 2 tho, LARGE footprint, and I don't think it would fit there)

4. DW1820A - M.2 (A/E) (BCM94350ZAE - 867Mbps - BT4.0 - 802.11a / b / g / n / ac) Please read before you buy: [link](https://osxlatitude.com/forums/topic/11322-broadcom-bcm4350-cards-under-high-sierramojavecatalina/)

# DW1820A

~~TLDR; WARNING: DON'T BUY DW1820A~~

~~WiFi is a headache. Recently I have brought Dell DW1820A wireless M.2 adaptor from AliExpress but sadly not properly working with Mojave. Generally, DW1820A is 3 types of card available. I choose the wrong part no, which is not working properly. There is kernel panic with it. If you really want to buy just buy the 0VW3T3 part. Pro tip doesn't buy it from AliExpress thy will always sent incorrect part no.~~

Edit: I haven't personally tested it however, it seems like DW18020A is working.
